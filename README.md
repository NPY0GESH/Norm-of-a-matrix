# Norm of a matrix
## Aim
To write a program to find the 1-norm, 2-norm and infinity norm of the matrix and display the result in two decimal places.
## Equipment’s required:
1.	Hardware – PCs
2.	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
	1. Get the input matrix using np.array()   
    2. Find the 2-norm of the matrix using np.linalg.norm()
	3. Print the norm of the matrix in two decimal places.
